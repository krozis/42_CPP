Problems encountered from correction :
	- Ex01 to ex03 : Form attributes _grade_to_sign and _grade_to_execute are supposed to be constants (weird but true).
	- Ex02 to Ex03 : Both of three Child Form are supposed to have only a target in arguments of constructor (So, no specific name for the Form).
